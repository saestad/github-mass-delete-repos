# github-mass-delete-repos
 Delete several github repositories at the same time.

 Having to confirm each repository becomes tedious when deleting lots of repositories. Using this program all you need is an access token and a list of which repos to delete and you're good in seconds. 

Todo:
- Add github access token and username in index.js
- Add repository names to repository_list.txt file seperated by commas
- npm install
- node index.js
